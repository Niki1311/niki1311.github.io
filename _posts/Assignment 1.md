As an 18-year-old university student studying digital humanities, I am continuously learning how to use technology efficiently in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I was always familiar with numerous social media platforms and online content production tools. Nevertheless, before I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities, I had never completely appreciated the possibilities of technology for research data storage, data manipulation, and analysis.

In my everyday life, I mostly utilize social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook to communicate with friends and family and to follow my favorite influencers and companies. I also make use of WhatsApp to keep in touch with my parents and video call them often through platforms like Google Meet and Zoom. I've always valued the ease of use and accessibility of these platforms for staying in touch with people. Yet, I've grown more conscious of the possible drawbacks and limitations of relying on social media too extensively, such as the influence on mental health and privacy issues.

To produce images and movies for personal projects, I utilize a number of applications such as Canva and Microsoft Power Point presentation. I've also lately found the power of using video editing tools like iMovies to improve and visually enhance my work.

In terms of managing research data, I have mostly used Google Drive to store and organize my academic papers and projects. I've also utilized Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as charting and graphing. Unfortunately, I've realized that these tools aren't always adequate for more advanced data processing and analysis.

The digital humanities course has introduced me to a wide range of technology and tools for research data management and analysis. I've learnt about data visualization like RStudio, as well as programming languages like Python and SQL for data manipulation and analysis. I'm intrigued by the potential of these tools to change the way we approach and analyze data, and I'm eager to learn more about how to use them in my academic and professional lives. I have also worked with Autodesk Fusion 360 to create graphical designs and models of 3D objects and be able to analyze their structure virtually.

Despite my past familiarity with technology and my newfound understanding from the digital humanities course, I believe my capabilities in this field are restricted. I am well aware that there is much more to learn, and I am eager to continue to broaden my abilities and knowledge in the sector.

Finally, my experience as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enlightening. I've grown to appreciate technology's potential for research data management, modification, and analysis, and I'm eager to learn more about how to use these tools successfully in my academic and professional lives. While I have some basic skills in content production and social interaction, I am aware that there is much more to learn in this area and am keen to continue to grow my knowledge and talents in this area.
