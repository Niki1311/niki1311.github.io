### Object History
#### The illustration is from the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar) which depicts the flight of Baz Bahadur, ruler of Malwa in north central India, after his defeat by the Mughals led by Adham Khan in 1561. In the foreground, soldiers fight; in the background is the fort of Malwa, with the Hindu ladies of the household shown at top right.It was sourced from the Akbarnama, also known as the Book of Akbar, which was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar (1556-1605) as the official chronicle of his reign. Abu’l Fazl, Akbar's court historian and biographer, wrote the text in Persian between 1590 and 1596. The V&A museum holds a partial copy of the manuscript, which is believed to have been illustrated between 1592 and 1595, making it the earliest known illustrated version of the text. The illustrations were created by some of the most skilled royal artists of the time, whose names are listed by Abu’l Fazl in the third volume of the text, the A’in-i Akbari. Some of these names are also present in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the images, suggesting that this was a royal copy created specifically for Akbar. After Akbar's death, the manuscript remained in the possession of his son Jahangir, who later passed it down to Shah Jahan. 
### Object History
#### In 1573, a battle occurred near Ahmadabad in north-west India between the Mughals and Muhammad Husain Mirza during the Mughal campaign to conquer Gujarat. The Mirza title was held by individuals descended from Timur, the Central Asian ruler who briefly conquered Hindustan in 1398, and as a result, Hindustan became a legitimate target for conquest by members of the different branches of the family. During the reign of Akbar (1556–1605), battles between Mughal forces and various Mirzas were frequent as each tried to gain control over a particular region. Muhammad Husain Mirza had taken advantage of Akbar's absence from Gujarat to try and seize the region, which led to the dispatch of Mughal forces to prevent this.
The two images that we have selected are from the Akbarnama, which was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar (1556–1605) as an official record of his reign. As a result, their metadata displays many similarities. Both images date back to the Mughal era and exhibit similar illustration styles, as observed by the images mentioned above. They were created in 1590 and their metadata reveals that the same materials and techniques were employed to create them, such as gold, ink, and opaque watercolors on paper. Additionally, they share the same dimensions of 32.8 x 19.2 cm, as they are both part of the same manuscript. Given that the metadata was obtained from the same library there is no discernible difference between the two.
Upon examining the metadata of the selected images, we found it to be extensive and accurate, providing valuable information. However we found it lacking in some details such as the names of the creators of the illustrations (image 1: Jagan and Qabu) and (image 2: Designed by the Mughal court artist Miskina with details painted by Banwali Khord). We also discovered some object history information that we believe would be beneficial to include in the metadata. Other than these missing details, the rest of the metadata was comprehensive and accurate. Adding this information would enhance the accessibility of the images and allow for a better understanding of the history.
The existing metadata for both illustrations is comprehensive enough that a simple search of the painting's title can yield relevant links. Therefore, there isn't much of a necessity to combine various pieces of information provided as metadata to locate them on the internet. We believe that the manner in which metadata is collected on the Digital Library for the Middle East is a valuable tool since it makes obtaining additional information about listed items straightforward. Even if one uses the metadata as is they can obtain a good overview of the item making this platform an excellent resource to have.
